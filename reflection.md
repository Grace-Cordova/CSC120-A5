Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My initial impression of association is that it connects a lot of what we were already doing. Making these connections makes it a lot easier to figure out what goes where and how to write what I'm writing. I had trouble knowing where exactly to ccatch and throw exceptions. I am also having some difficulties with asking a passenger to move to the next car when one is full. My advice to someone taking this course in the future is "you know more than you think you do. trust your gut."

UPDATED REFLECTION
I went through and added javadoc comments throughout the code. I was also able to go through and add a few accessors where I needed them. I also threw an exception if a person tried to get onboard that was already on the train. I also changed my method of catching the error of someone trying to get off a car that they weren't on by changing it from an if-else to throwing an exception. I feel much more confident about this assignment on this second go around!
